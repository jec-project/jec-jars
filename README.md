JEC JARS is a [JavaScript Entreprise Container][jec-url] project focused on the implementation of RESTful web services in JEC applications.

[![][jec-logo]][jec-url]

The `jars` package contains the abstration layer for creating RESTful
web services frameworks based on the JavaScript API for RESTful Services (JARS) specification.

## Requirements

JEC JARS needs the following system parameters in order to work correctly:

- Node 6+
- npm 3+
- TypeScript 2+

## Installation

Set up the JEC JARS module with:

```bash
$ npm install jec-jars --save
```

## Using Components

All JEC JARS components have to be imported with the ES6 syntax:

```javascript
import { ResourcePath, Exit, GET } from "jec-jars";

@ResourcePath("/hello")
export class Hello {

    @GET()
    public sayHelloWorld(@Exit exit:Function):void {
        exit("Hello World!");
    }
}
```

For a complete list of available components, please refer to the [API Reference](#api-reference) documentation.

## Running Tests

To execute all unit tests, use:

```bash
$ grunt test
```

## API Reference
